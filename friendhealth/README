The prototype is in a state where the core three tasks that we are asked to perform are able to be done. However, the tasks feature is not fully complete. One cannot reject a task or immediately take a photo there. New tasks cannot be generated or randomized. The calendar is also not functioning. This feature is not crucial in doing a prototype at this stage in the process. It does not have much to do with what tasks we have now. The scoreboard is also not critical to this prototype. The tasks do not involve these elements in the interface, so it is not necessary for the prototype. The activity screen should show a picture related to the task at hand. However, this is not a very critical aspect of the prototype right now, so it is not included in the prototype. The tutorial of our application is also not implemented since it is not a related task for this prototype. It would take a lot of time to make this work and should only be done when the interface is nearly finished. There is also no database backend for the application, even though it is needed for the actual application, since we did not have access to a database. Another reason is that the there needs to a significant amount of data for the tasks that are displayed to the user. There are three tasks that need to be displayed each time that the activity selector is displayed.
